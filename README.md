For this project I have 4 worksheets at the bottom, raw data, working sheet, pivot table, and dashboard. Each worksheet plays a role in building the final interactive dashboard.
Raw data - This worksheet has all the raw data that I used in the pivot tables and final dashboard. (Dataset is from AlextheAnalyst)
Working sheet - This worksheet is where I went over the data and made sure everything looked good from a data stand point. I got rid of duplicates and organized the data in a more clear way. I made sure to define male/female and single/married instead of M/F S/M. 
I also turned the ages into age brackets, so it would look better on the final dashboard.
Pivot table - This worksheet is where I played with different data to make pivot tables and how I could make correlations between diffrent factors of the customers. Factors like age, commute distance, # of children, etc.
Dashboard - This is the final worksheet. I inserted 3 of the charts based off of the pivot tables, I wanted. I also inserted 3 slicers (filters) so that users could see different metrics based off of the customer's region, education and marital status.
There are 3 text boxes to the right explainning each chart and what comapnies could do to maximize bike sales. This is an interactive dashboard, if you'd like to use the interactive dashboard my email is in my profile
